# cse15l-lab-reports

I included various `md` files in attempt of creating a multi-page blog post.

After careful instruction, though, I ended up creating one page for the whole blog post.

The main blog post is found in the `lab-report-1-week-2.md` file.

Also uploaded `png` images of the screenshots to include in the post.
