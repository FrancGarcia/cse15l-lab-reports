**How I Compared:**

To compare the two repositories and their results for this test, I utilized the command `diff markdown-parse/results.txt cse15l-markdown-parse/markdown-parse/results.txt`. `markdown-parse/results.txt` represents my repository while `cse15l-markdown-parse/markdown-parse/results.txt` represents Professor Joe's repository. This command shows the different results for my implementation versus Joe's implementation. According to the difference in results, we must check lines of the `results.txt` file. For the sake of time, I chose to check lines 270 and lines 850 for the two tests. According to the `results.txt` file, the first corresponding `test-file` is `22.md` found within `test-files`. This process is shown in the images above.

**Which is a Correct Implementation?:**

According to the `results.txt` file, the other corresponding `test-file` I'm comparing is `481.md` found within `test-files`. This process is shown in the images above.
