## How to log into a course-specific account on ieng6 (a remote server).

*By: **Francisco Garcia***

To begin logging into a course-specific account on ieng6, we first must understand what ieng6 is.
In it's most primitive terms, ieng6 is a remote server for clients utilizing "editors" such as 
Visual Studio Code.

For example, imagine you are on your laptop and you want to connect to the 
computer servers in the Computer Science Laboratory at UCSD.

The purpose of this is to execute powerful calculations that your small laptop simply can't perform.
Some calculations just require a lot of work. That is where servers come in handy for individuals to 
perform these complicated calculations with the help of these lab computers at UCSD.

Below is a quick sketch by Professor Politz describing what this process is like.
