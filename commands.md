# **STEP 3: Trying some Commands**
After connecting to the server `ieng6`, try running various commands in the terminal.
Try these commands (**this is not an exhaustive list**):
* `cd`
* `cd~`
* `ls -lat`
* `ls -a`
* `mkdir`
* `pwd`
Now try running some commands on your client. To do this, logout of the `ieng6` server 
simply by using `ctrl D` or typing `exit` and pressing enter in the terminal.

The image below should show the commands I ran on my Windows laptop and `ieng6` server.
