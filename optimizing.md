# **STEP 6: Optimizing Remote Running**
Now you're ready to go! In this class, you will always want to optimize as much as possible.
* In the case of remote running, you can use quotation marks for certain commands that you would like 
to run directly in the remote server.
* You can also use semicolons to run multiple commands in your terminal on one line.
* Don't forget! You can also use the `^` arrow to recall the prevoius commands.

Below is an image displaying how using  `;` and `^` looks like. Give it a try!

I really hope that helped! Don't forget, stay healthy amidst this pandemic!
